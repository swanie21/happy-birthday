        I hope you like this custom birthday e-card. I wanted to show off my new skills, but also make something special for you! You've reached the special age of senior <a href="http://www.boomerplaces.com/discounts/age65perks/" target="_blank">Discounts.</a> There's even a 5% off at Taco Bell. I hope you get to go fishing and enjoy the beautiful outdoors there. I feel that you're going to be a lucky guy today and will catch many fish...which you will eat. I'm hoping during my intermission in four weeks, starting September 24th, that I can come up there and visit. Then during that time I can make your favorite dessert and possibly even cookies! I love you dad!
